# Validator Selection Rubric

> Operationalizes PR #34 (Bioregional Validator Framework) into a concrete, scoreable rubric for the Regen Network authority validator set.

**Status:** Draft
**Spec dependency:** M014 (phase-2/2.6) -- Curated Authority Validator Set
**PR origin:** Gregory's PR #34 -- Bioregional Validator Framework
**Last updated:** 2026-03-24

---

## Overview

The bioregional validator framework (PR #34) establishes that Regen Network validators represent ecosystems and communities, not just servers. Validators are stewards of bioregional trust -- their legitimacy derives from ecological knowledge, institutional commitment, and geographic rootedness as much as from technical uptime.

This rubric translates that vision into a repeatable, transparent scoring framework that validator governance can apply consistently across all three validator categories. Every applicant is scored on a 1000-point scale against category-specific criteria. The rubric is designed to be machine-assistable (AGENT-004 can compute preliminary scores from on-chain and KOI data) while preserving human judgment for qualitative dimensions like mission alignment and bioregional engagement.

### Design Principles

1. **Transparency.** Every score component is defined, weighted, and published. Applicants can self-assess before applying.
2. **Bioregional primacy.** Geographic and ecological diversity are first-class criteria, not tiebreakers.
3. **Category fidelity.** Infrastructure Builders, Trusted ReFi Partners, and Ecological Data Stewards are evaluated on what makes each role distinct.
4. **Anti-entrenchment.** Term limits, rotation schedules, and rebalancing prevent validator capture.
5. **Conflict hygiene.** Undisclosed conflicts are disqualifying -- full stop.

### Validator Set Composition (from M014)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Total validators | 15--21 curated |
| Term length | 12 months |
| Categories | `infrastructure_builder`, `refi_partner`, `data_steward` |
| Minimum per category | 5 |
| Performance baseline | 99.5% uptime, governance participation, ecosystem contribution |
| Application mechanism | `MsgApplyValidator` with `evidence_iri` |

---

## Scoring Framework

**Total score: 1000 points.**
**Minimum eligibility threshold: 600 points.**

Each validator category has seven criteria weighted to reflect the priorities of that role. The criteria names are shared across categories, but their definitions and point allocations differ.

---

---

## Minimum Thresholds

All applicants must meet the following minimum thresholds to be eligible for a validator seat:

### Overall Threshold

- **Minimum total score: 600/1000.**
- Applicants scoring below 600 are not eligible regardless of category composition needs.

### Per-Criterion Minimums

No single criterion may fall below **25% of its maximum point value**:

| Criterion Max | Minimum Required |
|---|---|
| 200 | 50 |
| 150 | 37.5 (round to 38) |
| 100 | 25 |

An applicant with a total score of 750 but a Technical Infrastructure score of 40/200 is **not eligible** because 40 < 50 (25% of 200).

### Conflict of Interest Hard Floor

- **Conflict of Interest Disclosure must score at least 50/100.**
- Any score below 50 on the Conflict of Interest criterion is an automatic disqualification, regardless of overall score.
- Material undisclosed conflicts discovered at any point are grounds for immediate disqualification or removal.

---

## Conflict of Interest Rules

These rules apply to all three validator categories. Violations are disqualifying.

### Mandatory Disclosures

All applicants must disclose:

1. **Financial relationships** with credit class admins, project developers, marketplace operators, or other active authority validators.
2. **Shared beneficial ownership** above 10% with any other entity in the Regen Network ecosystem.
3. **Board memberships, advisory roles, or consulting relationships** with entities that originate, verify, or trade ecological credits on Regen Network.
4. **Pending or anticipated financial relationships** that could create conflicts during the 12-month term.

### Structural Prohibitions

The following conditions are disqualifying:

1. **Common control.** An applicant cannot be owned or controlled (directly or indirectly) by an entity that owns or controls another active authority validator. "Control" means holding more than 50% of voting rights or the ability to appoint a majority of the governing body.
2. **Dual role prohibition.** An applicant cannot simultaneously serve as a validator AND operate as an arbiter in M008/M009 dispute resolution processes. Organizations performing both roles must choose one or maintain strict organizational separation with independent governance.
3. **Shared beneficial ownership concentration.** If an individual or entity holds more than 10% beneficial ownership in two or more validator applicants or active validators, all affected entities must disclose this relationship and the governance committee must evaluate whether the concentration undermines set independence.

### Disclosure Failures

- **Pre-approval discovery:** Immediate disqualification from the current application cycle. The applicant may reapply in the next cycle with complete disclosures.
- **Post-approval discovery:** Grounds for removal proceedings. The governance committee initiates a removal proposal within 14 days of discovery. The validator is suspended from block production pending resolution.
- **Intentional concealment:** Permanent bar from the authority validator set. Intentional concealment is determined by governance committee vote (2/3 majority of active validators).

### Safe Harbor

Applicants who proactively disclose conflicts and propose reasonable mitigation measures (e.g., recusal policies, independent oversight, structural separation) will not be penalized for the existence of the conflict itself. The rubric rewards transparency. Scoring reflects the quality of disclosure and mitigation, not the mere existence of relationships.

---

## Rotation and Rebalancing Schedule

### Annual Term Renewal

- Standard terms are **12 months**, starting from the governance proposal approval date.
- **Streamlined re-application** for incumbents scoring 700 or above on their most recent evaluation: abbreviated application form, AGENT-004 auto-populates on-chain performance data, 7-day community review (instead of 14 days).
- Incumbents scoring 600--699 must submit a full application.
- Incumbents scoring below 600 at mid-term review are not eligible for streamlined renewal.

### Mid-Term Review (6 Months)

- At the 6-month mark, AGENT-004 generates a performance report for each active validator.
- The report includes: uptime, governance participation rate, ecosystem contribution metrics, and any flagged incidents.
- **Automatic review trigger:** If a validator's composite on-chain performance score drops below the equivalent of 600/1000 on the original rubric, a formal review is initiated.
- The governance committee may issue: (a) a warning with a 30-day improvement period, (b) a conditional continuation with specific requirements, or (c) a removal proposal.

### Composition Rebalancing

- If any category drops to its **minimum of 5** validators (due to removal, resignation, or term expiration), the governance committee activates a **priority queue** for that category.
- Priority queue: applications for the underrepresented category are reviewed on an accelerated 7-day timeline.
- If the set drops below 15 total validators, emergency applications are accepted on a rolling basis until the minimum is restored.

### Geographic Diversity Review

- **Quarterly check** by AGENT-004: computes geographic concentration metrics for the active set.
- **Flag threshold:** If more than 3 validators have their primary operations in the same geographic region (defined as UN M49 sub-region), AGENT-004 flags the concentration for governance committee attention.
- The flag does not trigger automatic action but is factored into subsequent application scoring (Geographic Diversity criterion becomes relatively more valuable for underrepresented regions).

### Term Limits

- **Maximum 2 consecutive terms** without a 1-term gap.
- After serving 2 consecutive 12-month terms (24 months), a validator must sit out for at least 1 full term (12 months) before reapplying.
- This prevents entrenchment while allowing experienced validators to return after a cooling-off period.
- Exception: if a category would drop below its minimum of 5, the term limit is suspended for that category until a replacement is seated.

---

## Scoring Process

### Step 1: Application Submission

The applicant submits a transaction via `MsgApplyValidator` containing:

- **Validator category:** `infrastructure_builder`, `refi_partner`, or `data_steward`
- **evidence_iri:** An IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) pointing to the application package stored on-chain or in a content-addressed store. The package includes all evidence documents referenced in the rubric.
- **Operator details:** Node configuration, key management attestation, contact information.
- **Conflict of interest disclosure form:** Completed template covering all mandatory disclosures.

### Step 2: Automated Preliminary Scoring (Layer 1)

AGENT-004 computes a preliminary score based on verifiable on-chain and KOI (Knowledge, Oracle, and Indexer) data:

- **On-chain metrics:** Transaction history, governance voting record, attestation count, credit origination volume, uptime history (if previously active).
- **Code contributions:** GitHub API integration for commit history, PR counts, repository contributions.
- **Geographic data:** Self-reported location cross-referenced with node IP geolocation and organizational registration data.

AGENT-004 produces a preliminary score for each criterion where automated evidence is available. Criteria that require qualitative judgment (e.g., Mission Alignment, Bioregional Engagement) receive a placeholder score of "pending human review" rather than an automated estimate.

### Step 3: Community Discussion (14 days)

- The application and AGENT-004's preliminary score are published to the governance forum.
- Community members have 14 days to comment, ask questions, and flag concerns.
- The applicant is expected to respond to substantive questions during this period.
- Community sentiment is not formally scored but informs the governance committee's review.

### Step 4: Governance Committee Review (Layer 3)

The validator governance committee (composed of existing active validators) reviews each application:

- Evaluates qualitative criteria that AGENT-004 cannot score.
- Adjusts AGENT-004's automated scores where committee members have additional context.
- Considers community discussion feedback.
- Applies minimum threshold checks.
- Produces a final score with written justification for each criterion.

Scoring is conducted independently by each committee member, then averaged. Outlier scores (more than 2 standard deviations from the mean on any criterion) are discussed before final averaging.

### Step 5: Final Approval

- Applications meeting all thresholds are submitted as governance proposals.
- Active validators vote to approve or reject.
- Approval requires a simple majority of active validators.
- Approved validators are added to the active set in the next epoch.

| IB-5: Geographic Diversity | 85/100 | Pacific Northwest (Cascadia bioregion) not currently represented in active set. Nodes hosted in Portland and Vancouver BC. |
| IB-6: Bioregional Engagement | 90/100 | Formal partnership with Willamette Watershed Council. Hosts data for local salmon monitoring program. Active in Cascadia Bioregion movement governance. |
| IB-7: Conflict of Interest | 85/100 | Complete disclosure. No conflicts identified. Cooperative governance structure ensures independence. |
| **Total** | **765/1000** | **Eligible.** Strong technical and bioregional profile. Code contributions are the weakest area but above minimum threshold (95 > 50). |

### Example 2: Trusted ReFi Partner -- Cerrado Carbon Collective

**Background:** A Brazilian organization that facilitates carbon credit origination from cerrado biome restoration projects. Works directly with smallholder farming cooperatives. 18 months in operation.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| RP-1: Ecosystem Activity | 145/200 | Active credit originator for 12 months. 15 credit batches originated across 3 credit classes. Moderate transaction volume (second quartile). Growing trajectory. |
| RP-2: Mission Alignment | 170/200 | Organization exists solely to channel finance to cerrado restoration. Published impact report documenting 2,400 hectares under restoration management. Team includes agroforestry experts and community organizers. |
| RP-3: Community Engagement | 85/150 | Votes on most governance proposals. Occasional forum posts. Organized one community workshop in Sao Paulo. Limited English-language engagement (language barrier, not disinterest). |
| RP-4: Institutional Stability | 55/150 | 18 months in operation. Funded by credit sales revenue and one foundation grant. Team of 4. Brazilian LLC established. Funding somewhat dependent on credit market conditions. |
| RP-5: Geographic Diversity | 95/100 | Cerrado biome (Brazil) not currently represented. Addresses significant gap in South American coverage. |
| RP-6: Bioregional Engagement | 95/100 | Works directly with 12 smallholder farming cooperatives in Goias state. Community-led restoration planning. Local employment and capacity building programs. |
| RP-7: Conflict of Interest | 70/100 | Adequate disclosure. Organization originates credits that would be validated on the chain it helps secure -- inherent tension disclosed with mitigation (recusal from credit class governance votes for classes they originate). |
| **Total** | **715/1000** | **Eligible.** Exceptional bioregional engagement and mission alignment. Institutional stability is the weakest area (55 > 38 minimum) -- committee notes this for mid-term monitoring. |

### Example 3: Ecological Data Steward -- Alpine Monitoring Institute

**Background:** A Swiss research institute specializing in alpine ecosystem monitoring. 15 years of operation. Extensive publication record. New to blockchain and Regen Network specifically.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| DS-1: Scientific Credentials | 190/200 | Team includes 8 PhDs in ecology, glaciology, and remote sensing. 200+ peer-reviewed publications. Developed two methodologies adopted by Verra. Active in IPCC Working Group II. |
| DS-2: Data Quality Track Record | 60/200 | No on-chain attestation history. However, 15 years of ecological monitoring data with rigorous quality control. 3 pilot attestations on Regen testnet during application period. Score reflects absence of Regen-specific track record despite exceptional general data quality credentials. |
| DS-3: Mission Alignment | 140/150 | Institute's sole mission is alpine ecosystem research and conservation. Open data policy for all published datasets. Active contributor to European ecological data commons. |
| DS-4: Institutional Stability | 145/150 | 15 years in operation. Funded by Swiss National Science Foundation, EU Horizon grants, and cantonal government. Team of 35. Established foundation under Swiss law. |
| DS-5: Geographic Diversity | 70/100 | European Alps. One existing validator in broader European region but none in alpine ecosystems specifically. Brings unique biome representation. |
| DS-6: Bioregional Engagement | 75/100 | Extensive partnerships with Swiss Alpine Club, local canton environmental offices, and mountain farming communities. Community science program engages 200+ volunteer observers. Some engagement is scientific rather than governance-oriented. |
| DS-7: Conflict of Interest | 95/100 | Complete disclosure. Fully independent from credit issuers. No commercial ecological credit relationships. Research funding comes from public sources. |
| **Total** | **775/1000** | **Eligible.** Exceptional scientific credentials and institutional stability. Data Quality Track Record is the concern area (60 > 50 minimum) -- strong general credentials but limited on-chain history. Committee recommends close mid-term review of attestation activity. |
