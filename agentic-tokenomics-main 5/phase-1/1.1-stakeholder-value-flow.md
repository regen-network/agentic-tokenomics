# Phase 1.1: Stakeholder & Value Flow Mapping

## Overview

This document maps the stakeholder ecosystem and value flows within Regen Network, following the Stakeholder Pentad framework from the meta-prompt.

## Stakeholder Pentad

### 1. Earth (Ecological Systems)
**Role**: Ultimate beneficiary of regenerative outcomes

| Aspect | Current State | Gap Identified |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Representation | Implicit through credit retirement | No explicit on-chain representation |
| Value Received | Legitimacy through verified outcomes | Needs "Ecological State" attestations |
| Value Contributed | Ecological services measured by credits | MRV data flows need formalization |

**Recommendation**: Create on-chain ecological state attestations to explicitly represent Earth's interests.

### 2. Community (Land Stewards & Project Developers)
**Role**: Create ecological value through land-based activities

| Value Received | Value Contributed |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Market access | Ecological data & outcomes |
| Co-marketing | Local knowledge |
| Verification services | Project management |
| Credit revenue | Community engagement |
| Technical support | Ground-truth validation |

**On-Chain Representation**: Project admins, credit recipients, forum participants

### 3. Customers (Credit Buyers & Retirees)
**Role**: Provide demand signal and financial resources

| Value Received | Value Contributed |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Verified credits | Purchase payments |
| Retirement certificates | Market liquidity |
| Impact claims | Demand signals |
| Compliance documentation | Price discovery |

**On-Chain Representation**: Retirement addresses, marketplace buyers

### 4. Co-Creators (Validators, Verifiers, Methodology Developers)
**Role**: Maintain infrastructure and standards

| Stakeholder Type | Value Received | Value Contributed |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Validators | Staking rewards, commission | Block production, security |
| Verifiers | Verification fees | Quality assurance |
| Methodology Devs | Licensing, recognition | Standards development |
| Software Devs | Grants, employment | Code, maintenance |

**On-Chain Representation**: Validator addresses, class issuers, verifier addresses

### 5. Investors (Token Holders & Delegators)
**Role**: Provide capital and governance participation

| Value Received | Value Contributed |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Governance rights | Capital allocation |
| Staking yield | Governance participation |
| Appreciation potential | Security through stake |
| Network access | Liquidity provision |

**On-Chain Representation**: Token holders, delegators, governance voters

}
```

## Gaps Identified

1. **Earth Representation Gap**: No explicit on-chain mechanism represents ecological outcomes
2. **Community Discovery Gap**: Land stewards not easily discoverable on-chain
3. **Verifier Registry Gap**: No formal on-chain verifier reputation system
4. **Value Attribution Gap**: Difficult to trace value flow from retirement to ecological outcome

## Recommendations for Phase 2

1. Design ecological state attestation mechanism (M008)
2. Create reputation signaling system for stakeholders (M010)
3. Formalize verifier registry with bonding requirements
4. Implement value flow tracking through KOI objects
