# Phase 1.2: Tokenomic Mechanisms Inventory

## Overview

This document catalogs all existing and proposed tokenomic mechanisms within Regen Network, assessing their automation potential.

## Active Mechanisms (On-Chain)

### M001: Staking Mechanism
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module** | x/staking |
| **Purpose** | Secure network, enable governance |
| **Token Flow** | Holder → Validator → Rewards |
| **Current State** | Active, 75 validators |
| **Automation Potential** | High (monitoring, alerts) |
| **PoA Status** | **Superseded by M014**. Under PoA, the open validator set is replaced by a curated 15-21 authority set. Inflation-based staking rewards are disabled; validators are compensated from M013 fee routing. Existing stake positions must be unbonded during the transition period. See [M014 spec](../phase-2/2.6-economic-reboot-mechanisms.md) and OQ-M014-5. |

### M002: Governance Voting
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module** | x/gov |
| **Purpose** | Decentralized decision-making |
| **Token Flow** | Staked weight → Vote power |
| **Current State** | Active, 61+ proposals |
| **Parameters** | 7-day voting, quorum-based |
| **Automation Potential** | Medium (analysis, not voting) |
| **PoA Status** | **Modified by M014 + M015**. Under PoA, vote power transitions from capital-weighted (1 REGEN = 1 vote) to a dual-track model: authority validators vote with equal weight per validator, token holders participate with contribution-weighted scores (M015). The x/gov module parameters (VotingPeriod, Quorum, Threshold) remain but the tally logic changes. See M001-ENH PoA Impact section for the dual-track voting specification. |

### M003: Transaction Fees
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module** | x/auth, x/bank |
| **Purpose** | Spam prevention, validator rewards |
| **Token Flow** | Sender → Validators |
| **Current State** | Active |
| **Automation Potential** | Low (parameter monitoring only) |
| **PoA Status** | **Superseded by M013**. Flat gas fees are replaced by value-based percentage fees with multi-pool routing (burn, validators, community, agent infrastructure). Minimum gas fees remain for spam prevention. |

### M004: Marketplace Escrow
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module** | x/ecocredit/marketplace |
| **Purpose** | Trustless credit trading |
| **Token Flow** | Buyer → Escrow → Seller |
| **Current State** | Active, 23+ orders |
| **Currencies** | USDC.grv, USDC.axl, EEUR, REGEN |
| **Automation Potential** | High (monitoring, curation) |

### M005: Community Pool Treasury
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module** | x/distribution |
| **Purpose** | Fund ecosystem development |
| **Token Flow** | Block rewards → Pool → Recipients |
| **Current State** | ~3.2M REGEN |
| **Automation Potential** | Low (human decisions) |
| **PoA Status** | **Modified by M013 + M015**. Inflow source changes from block rewards (inflation) to M013 fee routing (community share of real revenue). Distribution shifts from governance-only to hybrid: M015 automatic activity-based rewards + governance-directed spending (existing GOV-004 process). |

### M006: Credit Class Creator Allowlist
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module** | x/ecocredit |
| **Purpose** | Quality control for registries |
| **Token Flow** | Governance proposal deposit |
| **Current State** | Active, permissioned |
| **Automation Potential** | High (screening, recommendation) |

### M007: Currency Allow List
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Module** | x/ecocredit/marketplace |
| **Purpose** | Control accepted payment tokens |
| **Token Flow** | Governance proposal deposit |
| **Current State** | 4 currencies enabled |
| **Automation Potential** | High (criteria evaluation) |

## Proposed Mechanisms: Economic Reboot

> **Note**: M012-M015 formalize the [Economic Reboot Roadmap](https://forum.regen.network/t/regen-economic-reboot-roadmap/567). Full specifications in [phase-2/2.6-economic-reboot-mechanisms.md](../phase-2/2.6-economic-reboot-mechanisms.md).

### M012: Fixed Cap Dynamic Supply
| Attribute | Proposed Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Replace inflation with hard-capped algorithmic mint/burn |
| **Token Flow** | Protocol → Mint (regrowth) / Burn (from fees) |
| **Key Formula** | S[t+1] = S[t] + r(C - S[t]) - B[t] |
| **Hard Cap** | ≈ 221M REGEN |
| **Automation Potential** | High (algorithmic; agent monitoring) |

### M013: Value-Based Fee Routing
| Attribute | Proposed Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Replace flat gas with value-proportional fees |
| **Token Flow** | Fee Payer → Burn / Validators / Community / Agent Infra |
| **Fee Types** | Issuance 1-3%, Transfer 0.1%, Retirement 0.5%, Trade 1% |
| **Automation Potential** | High (fully algorithmic routing) |

### M014: Authority Validator Governance
| Attribute | Proposed Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Transition from PoS to contribution-weighted PoA |
| **Participants** | Infrastructure builders, ReFi partners, data stewards |
| **Validator Set** | 15-21 curated validators |
| **Automation Potential** | Medium (AGENT-004 monitoring; human selection) |

### M015: Contribution-Weighted Rewards
| Attribute | Proposed Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Replace passive staking with activity-based rewards |
| **Token Flow** | Community Pool → Activity scores → Participants |
| **Activities** | Credit purchase/retire, platform facilitation, governance |
| **Automation Potential** | High (on-chain activity tracking) |

## Proposed Mechanisms: Ecosystem Services

### M008: Data Attestation Bonding
| Attribute | Proposed Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Incentivize accurate ecological data |
| **Token Flow** | Attester → Bond Pool → Release/Slash |
| **Participants** | Attesters, Challengers, Arbiters |
| **Bond Range** | 500-5,000 REGEN by attestation type |
| **Automation Potential** | High (monitoring, challenge detection) |

### M009: Service Provision Escrow
| Attribute | Proposed Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Trustless service engagement |
| **Token Flow** | Client → Escrow → Milestones → Provider |
| **Participants** | Clients, Providers, Arbiters |
| **Service Types** | Verification, methodology dev, MRV |
| **Automation Potential** | Medium (milestone tracking) |

### M010: Reputation/Legitimacy Signaling
| Attribute | Proposed Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Stake-weighted endorsement system |
| **Token Flow** | No transfer (weight from stake) |
| **Participants** | Signalers, Subjects, Aggregator |
| **Categories** | Quality, Legitimacy, Competence, Rigor |
| **Automation Potential** | High (aggregation, monitoring) |
